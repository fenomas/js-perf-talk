# js-perf-talk

Talk on JS performance optimization.

**[Live demo](https://fenomas.github.io/js-perf-talk/)** 


### Usage

```sh
# (clone the repo)
> cd js-perf-talk
> npm install
> npm start         # to give the presentation. Completely close Chrome first!
> npm run build     # builds static output to ./www
> npm run serve     # serves locally on port 1948, without opening a browser
> npm run browse    # opens Chrome with useful v8 flags
```


To give the presentation with all its bells and whistles, use `npm run local`. 
Make sure Chrome is completely closed first, so it can launch with the necessary v8 flags.
